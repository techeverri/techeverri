### Hey there 👋

My name is Tomas. I’m a Software Engineer from 🇨🇴 Colombia living in 🇸🇪
Stockholm, Sweden. I like 🌶 spicy food, 🚲 cycling and 🧺 picnics. In my free
time, I mostly play 🏸 badminton (singles and doubles), 🏐 volleyball (indoor,
beach, and grass), and very seldom I play ⚽️ football. I am an enthusiast of
technology and programming, specially web development. I try to contribute to
open-source software projects when I'm not watching 📺 films or TV shows with my
wife 👰
